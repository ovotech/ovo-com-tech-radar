The OVO.com Technology Radar is a living document that captures and provides a
high-level overview of our technology landscape.

The radar consists of four quadrants:

- **Techniques**  
  Includes various aspects of software development process and ways of working.
- **Languages & Frameworks**  
  Our main programming languages and key frameworks used for development.
- **Platforms**  
  Platforms that we use to build our software on top, e.g. databases, cloud
  services etc.
- **Tools**  
  Various software development tools that make our lives easier.

Each quadrant is divided into four rings:

- **Adopt**  
  Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large
  scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our OVO production environment,
  low risk and recommended to be widely used.
- **Assess**  
  Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
  technologies worth investing research and proof of concept efforts in to see
  if they may add value. These technologies have higher risks; they are often
  brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some
  engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even
  find teams that have started a proof of concept effort.
- **Trial**  
  Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a
  real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can
  uncover limitations. These technologies are slightly more risky; some
  engineers in our organisation have used them before and will share knowledge
  and experiences.
- **Hold**  
  Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we
  think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. The technologies should not
  be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.

## Why you should use the Radar

A consistent technology stack is often a big driver of delivery efficiency, cost
effectiveness and knowledge sharing across teams and the Technology Radar is an
important tool that helps us in discussions about the technologies that we want
to standardise on and invest in as an organisation.

## FAQs

### Why is there only the Adopt ring on the Radar?

We've initially created the Radar only with technologies in the Adopt ring to
emphasize the focus on technologies which are already widely adopted and used in
production at OVO.com, but we will expand it to other rings in the future.

### What to do if a technology I want to trial is not listed here?

To assess or trial a new technology that's not listed on the Radar, please use
our #ovo-com-tech Slack channel to start a discussion and share your use case
with others.

### What to do if the technology I want to use is listed in the Adopt ring?

You should feel free to adopt the technology on your project, but we encourage
everyone to reach out to our engineering community on Slack in #ovo-com-tech
channel to validate their design, find our more about how the technology is
currently used and get some general advice from others.
